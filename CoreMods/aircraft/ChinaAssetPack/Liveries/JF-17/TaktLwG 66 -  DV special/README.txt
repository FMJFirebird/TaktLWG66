JF-17 Chinese New Year - 2021 Year of the Ox livery by PRCCOWBOY
Traditional Chinese New Year Good Luck/Prosperity theme for the Year of the Ox

I wanted to do a Chinese New Year/Holiday themed livery and of course the JF-17 was the natural choice. My original livery (which looked like a Holiday greeting card with lanterns and such) was met with disapproval by my local SME for having "no meaning", so I started over after doing more research on the subject. This is the result.

This Chinese New Year Livery for the JF-17 (Chinese Xiao Long or "fierce dragon") employs traditional Chinese symbology and colors for luck/prosperity, mixing elements of the sea and sky, the traditional Chinese Phoenix (with body of a pheasant, feathers like a peacocks, and wings of a roc) and the Dragon (together representing the yin and yang), and the nine dragon blessings.

The symbol on the tail is the Chinese Fu symbol meaning "fortune" or "good luck"

Happy Chinese New Year. May you have a good Year of the Ox. (Xin Nian Kuai Le/Gong Xi Fa Cai)
